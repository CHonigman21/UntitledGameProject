# UntitledGameProject
# Progress as of 7/15/2020
# The goal of of this project is to create a text-based adventure game (Hopefully adding visual elements later on)
# As of now, the player can build their character and traverse the game world.
# The game world is a tree structure, thatt is randomly generated at the beginning of the game using a prufer sequence.
# My goals for the next update of this repository are to add the nonplayer characters to the world and
# add interactions between the player and these characters (combat or otherwise).
