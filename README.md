# UntitledGameProject
# Progress as of 7/15/2020
# The goal of of this project is to create a text-based adventure game (Hopefully adding visual elements later on)
# As of now, the player can build their character and traverse the game world.
# The game world is a tree structure, thatt is randomly generated at the beginning of the game using a prufer sequence.
# My goals for the next update of this repository are to add the nonplayer characters to the world and
# add interactions between the player and these characters (combat or otherwise).

# HOW TO RUN:
# 1. Make sure that java is part of your path
# 2. Set your working directory to the dist folder in the DungeonGame folder
# 3. type this into cmd line: "java -jar DungeonGame.jar"

# "Controls"
# Go through left tunnel: "left"
# Go through right tunnel: "right"
# Go through middle tunnel: "center"
# Go to previous cave: "back"
